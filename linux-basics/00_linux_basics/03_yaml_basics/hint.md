# Hints for YAML Basics

- YAML is case-sensitive. Ensure that you maintain the correct capitalization.
- When adding to a list in YAML, ensure that the new item is aligned with the other items in the list and starts with a `-` (dash) followed by a space.
- Strings in YAML don't always need to be enclosed in quotes, but it's a good practice when the string looks like something that might be misinterpreted as another type, such as numbers.
