# Editing Files with nano/vim

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll get hands-on experience with two popular Linux text editors: nano and vim. Both editors are commonly used in Linux environments, and it's useful to be familiar with at least one of them.

## Task

1. Navigate to the `file-editing` directory.
2. Open the `editme.txt` file using either nano or vim.
3. Replace the line in the file with: "Successfully edited with [editor-name]." where [editor-name] is either `nano` or `vim` based on the editor you used.
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Once you've completed the task, run the `check.sh` script to verify your work.
