# Create a simple service for an ingress

**Task:** Create a Pod with `nginx` image listening on port 80 in the `dev3` namespace. Create a service called `webserver` in the `dev3` namespace. The service should expose this pod on port `80`.

You should now be able to reach the pod from the existing ingress.
