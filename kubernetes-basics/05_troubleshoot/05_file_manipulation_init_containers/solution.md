Upon inspecting the logs of the init container, you might realize that the file creation was not successful. Recreate the pod to fix the issue.

```bash
kubectl get pod snow -n winter -o yaml > snow.yaml
```

And then modify the `prepare-file` and `process-file` containers' `args` to:

```yaml
# container: prepare-file
args: ["echo 'Snowflakes are unique!' > /data-dir/data.txt"]
```

and

```yaml
# container: process-file
args: ["cat /data-dir/data.txt || echo 'Unable to read file'"]
```

Replace the existing pod using replace:

```bash
kubectl replace -f snow.yaml
```

After fixing, the logs of `process-file` should print `Snowflakes` are unique!.
