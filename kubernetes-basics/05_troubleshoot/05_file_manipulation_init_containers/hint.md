Try to inspect the init container's logs to see what it's doing. The `kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>` command can help here. If the init container is failing, the main container won't even start. You can find the documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-init-containers/). You can edit the pod's specification using `kubectl edit pod <pod_name>`.
