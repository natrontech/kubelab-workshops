You can use `kubectl scale` to scale the deployment. To perform an update, use `kubectl set image`. Rollbacks can be performed using `kubectl rollout undo`. 

More on scaling [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#scaling-a-deployment), updating [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images) and rollback [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-back-a-deployment).
