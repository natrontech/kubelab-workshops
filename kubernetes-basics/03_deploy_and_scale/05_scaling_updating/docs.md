# Deployment Scaling and Rolling Updates

**Task:** Scale down the `hot` deployment in the `summer` namespace to `3` replicas. Perform a rolling update to change the nginx image used from version `1.14` to `1.20`. In the case of any failures, make sure you know how to rollback to the previous state.
