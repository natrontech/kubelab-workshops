**hint**: The `spec.containers.name` field is not editable. You have to delete the pod and create a new one.
You can use the `kubectl get -o yaml` command to gather a YAML formated file of the pod that you can edit and apply.

You can find the documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/#operations).
