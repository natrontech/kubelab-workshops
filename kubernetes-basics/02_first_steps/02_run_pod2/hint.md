**hint**: You can use the `kubectl run` command to create a pod. You can find the documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#interacting-with-running-pods).

You can also create a pod using a yaml file as described [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#using-pods)
