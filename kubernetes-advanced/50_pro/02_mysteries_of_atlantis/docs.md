# **Mysteries of Atlantis: The Extended Kubernetes Odyssey**

Legend tells of the sunken city of Atlantis, a place of unparalleled power and knowledge. Your mission is to reawaken Atlantis using the might of Kubernetes.

Use the `atlantis` namespace for your journey.

**Tasks:**
1. Create the **Web Relic** (`web-app`) and ensure it serves the masses on port `80`.
2. Unearth the **Database of Knowledge** (`db-backend`) using the `postgres:alpine` image.
3. Use the `oracle-inscription` ConfigMap to decipher your journey.
4. The Database of Knowledge requires the storage artifact (`database-artifact`). Ensure its endurance with the `nfs-data` storage class.
5. Connect the Web Relic to the Database of Knowledge.
6. Invoke the **Guardian of Secrets** (`guardian-secret`). Decrypt its knowledge and apply it to secure your deployments.
7. Ensure the **Web Relic** utilizes the guardian's secrets for its credentials.
8. Enable Network Policies to ensure only the Web Relic can communicate with the Database of Knowledge.

Tread carefully, for the depths hide both wonders and dangers!
